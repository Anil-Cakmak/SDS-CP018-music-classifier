# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the The Music Translator - Genre Classification Using Audio Spectrograms repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

# Project Overview
The Music Translator is an application designed to classify songs into genres using audio spectrograms and a deep learning model. The project will process audio files, convert them into spectrogram images, and use a pre-trained or custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the genre. The app will be deployed as an interactive web interface using Streamlit, allowing users to upload audio files and get instant genre predictions.

## Objectives

### Audio Preprocessing:
- Process audio files to generate spectrograms.
- Normalize and prepare spectrograms for input into the CNN model.

### Genre Classification:
- Use a trained CNN model to classify audio spectrograms into genres.

### User Interaction:
- Build an intuitive Streamlit interface for audio upload and genre classification.
- Display results along with spectrogram visualization.

## Key Features

### Audio File Upload:
- Users upload audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV).
- Limit file size and duration for optimal processing.

### Spectrogram Visualization:
- Generate and display the spectrogram of the uploaded audio file.

### Genre Prediction:
- Predict the genre of the audio using a pre-trained CNN model.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- Streamlit app for easy interaction, with results displayed in real-time.

## Project Deliverables

### Functional Streamlit Application:
- A deployed web app allowing users to upload audio files and get genre predictions.

### Audio Preprocessing Pipeline:
- Convert audio files to spectrograms using Librosa or similar libraries.
- Normalize and preprocess the spectrograms for model input.

### Trained CNN Model:
- Pre-trained or custom-trained CNN capable of classifying genres with reasonable accuracy.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend:
- Streamlit for building the user interface.

### Backend:
Python libraries for audio processing and deep learning:
- Librosa: For audio-to-spectrogram conversion.
- Matplotlib: For spectrogram visualization.
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch: For the CNN model.

## Workflow

### Data Preprocessing:
- Convert uploaded audio files into spectrograms using Librosa.
- Resize spectrograms to match the input size of the CNN model.
- Extract features from the audio files to use for training the CNN.

### Model Integration: Week 2 + 3
- Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16 fine-tuned for spectrograms) or train a custom model using datasets like GTZAN Music Genre Dataset.
- Load the trained model into the app for inference.

### Web App Development: Week 3/4
- Create an interactive Streamlit interface with:
  - Audio file upload functionality.
  - Visualization of the spectrogram.
  - Display of the predicted genre.

### Deployment:
- Deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud.
